This app was developed using the Express framework alongside the MVC (i.e. models, views, controllers) scheme. It contains information about books, authors, and genres. It is possible to create all of this using Moongose to model each book, author, and genre. I also added the functionality to edit, delete, and create any book, author, and genre. Pug is used as the template engine in this case. Pug was useful since the were pany pages in the website so using HTML would have meant to write a whole HTML file for each web page. With pug on the other hand, one can use the file as the base structure and then reference it in the other .pug files to avoid repeating code and different files.
